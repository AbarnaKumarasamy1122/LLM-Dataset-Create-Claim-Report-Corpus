Model Selection: google/flan-t5-base

Reasoning:
==========

1. Model Characteristics:
   - Size: 250M parameters
   - Type: Sequence-to-sequence (encoder-decoder)
   - Training: Instruction-tuned on diverse tasks

2. Why FLAN-T5-base for Claim Report Generation:
   
   ✅ Perfect for Seq2Seq Tasks:
      - Our task is structured input → natural language output
      - FLAN-T5 excels at following instructions and generating coherent text
   
   ✅ Resource Efficiency:
      - Requires 12-16 GB GPU (or 8-10 GB with LoRA)
      - Training time: 2-4 hours for 3 epochs
      - Can run on Google Colab Pro or modest local GPU
   
   ✅ Pre-trained on Instructions:
      - Already understands task-based prompts
      - Fine-tuning will adapt it to claim report format
      - Less data needed compared to base models
   
   ✅ Production Ready:
      - Stable and well-documented
      - Active community support
      - Easy integration with Hugging Face ecosystem
   
   ✅ Quality vs. Cost:
      - Better quality than FLAN-T5-small
      - More practical than larger models (Mistral/Llama)
      - Optimal for MVP and production deployment

3. Dataset Compatibility:
   - Our dataset: 6,612 examples, ~69 tokens/example
   - FLAN-T5-base: 512 token context window
   - Perfect fit: avg 31 input + 38 output = 69 tokens << 512

4. Alternative Models (Not Selected):
   
   ❌ FLAN-T5-small (80M):
      - Too small, may produce lower quality outputs
      - Use only if GPU severely limited (<6GB)
   
   ❌ FLAN-T5-large (780M):
      - Overkill for this task
      - 3x training time, 2x GPU memory
      - Marginal quality improvement
   
   ❌ Mistral-7B:
      - Requires 32+ GB GPU
      - 3-4x longer training time
      - Decoder-only (better for chat, not structured output)
   
   ❌ Llama-3-8B:
      - Requires 40+ GB GPU
      - Access restrictions (gated model)
      - Decoder-only architecture

5. Training Strategy:
   - Use LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for memory efficiency
   - Parameters: r=8, alpha=32
   - Target modules: ["q", "v"] (attention layers)
   - Expected GPU: 8-10 GB with LoRA

6. Expected Performance:
   - BLEU Score: 40-60 (good for this task)
   - ROUGE-L: 50-70
   - Training convergence: 2-3 epochs
   - Inference speed: ~50-100 examples/second
